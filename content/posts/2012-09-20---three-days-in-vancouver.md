description: "I never thought I would like a city as much as I did London (UK, not sure how many times I have had to clarify that in the past six months) but Vancouver comes close. The park, the beaches, the people, the food and the culture. It has it all.  I see it as a Melbourne with a nicer park and beaches on the ocean, not a port."

I never thought I would like a city as much as I did London (UK, not sure how many times I have had to clarify that in the past six months) but Vancouver comes close. The park, the beaches, the people, the food and the culture. It has it all.  I see it as a Melbourne with a nicer park and beaches on the ocean, not a port.

# Day 1 - Whistler

Drive up to Whistler, it takes about 1.5 hours from downtown Vancouver to the village, spend the day hiking, skiing, boarding or mountain biking around the mountain depending on your preference and the season. I went in September and the weather was perfect, bright blue sunny sky with few clouds.

Either spend the night up on Whistler or drive back and stay in downtown Vancouver.  There's plenty of hotel options for you.

# Day 2 - Downtown Vancouver

Hire a bike to get yourself around, you'll save a lot of time but still experience everything from the ground. Stanley Park is great, there's plenty to see and do, relax on the beach, on the grass, enjoy the ambience and marvel at the surrounding mountains.

Head to Gastown for the evening, [Salt Tasting Room](http://www.salttastingroom.com/) on Blood Alley for an experience: wine/cheese/meat pairings, the portions look small but you won't leave hungry.

There's plenty of nightclubs, bars and restaurants around the area to keep you entertained.

# Day 3 - Victoria

It's a huge island, plus it has a city called Sydney.  I haven't been there but I've heard it's worth a look.
