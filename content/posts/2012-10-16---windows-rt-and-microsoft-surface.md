description: "So today I bit the bullet and pre-ordered a [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/). I was always opposed to buying an [Apple iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) because I couldn't justify the cost for something I doubted I would get much use out of. The difference with the Surface is that it's a Microsoft product and I'm a Microsoft developer. I have toyed with objective-c and it's just a pain, developer support (documentation, tools, updates, tutorials, etc...) from Microsoft is 100 times that of Apple's and .NET is a very, *very* nice environment to develop with."

So today I bit the bullet and pre-ordered a [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/). I was always opposed to buying an [Apple iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/) because I couldn't justify the cost for something I doubted I would get much use out of. The difference with the Surface is that it's a Microsoft product and I'm a Microsoft developer. I have toyed with objective-c and it's just a pain, developer support (documentation, tools, updates, tutorials, etc...) from Microsoft is 100 times that of Apple's and .NET is a very, *very* nice environment to develop with.

Since I have 10 days to wait until the product ships all I can do now is toy around with building Metro styled apps in Visual Studio and see what I can come up with when I get to hold my new toy in my hands.

The task I have taken on is trying to develop a management tool for this website. Blog posts, trips, projects, clients, invoices, etc... No doubt I'll come across some interesting nuances and I'll be blogging about them.

I came across [this walk through](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974581.aspx) for creating a (very) basic application, it assumes a basic knowledge of C#/.NET/Visual Studio.  It doesn't assume a platform - the application you're working on can be for mobile, tablet/Surface or desktop.
