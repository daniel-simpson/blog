It's finally here!  I made the switch at beta, then *upgraded* to the RC, now the Visual Studio 2012 RTM launch has been announced.  August 15th for MSDN subscribers (all the more reason to sign up... $800/year for basically all MS products isn't too bad...), or September 12th for everybody else.

I'm excited.  Visual Studio keeps getting better and better.  Now I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
