I'm a little late to the party on this one, but I just watched Anders Hejlsberg's announcement (*... from 2010*) on it and must say that I am very impressed.

`async` and `await` will make asynchronous development an absolute breeze.  Having not done much with it myself, I can't really give any tips, pointers, advice or musings, but [here is the video from PDC 10](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/PDC/PDC10/FT09) announcing it, and [Eric Lippert's blog posts](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/10/28/asynchrony-in-c-5-part-one.aspx) running through the details.

One question I had was about how asynchronism works with only one thread, you can find a bit of a run through it [here](http://krondo.com/?p=1209).
