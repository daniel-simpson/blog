This has been discussed over and over and over and over again, and you would think in 2012 with HTML5 this conversation would have been put to sleep a long time ago.  Unfortunately, not.

Tables have their place in HTML, but it appears some people haven't received the memo as to what that place is.

Tables are for *tabular* data.  Not layout.

Saying that you shouldn't use tables is wrong, it's another case of *right tool for the right job*.

If you need to position elements in your HTML document, use CSS.  If you need to list data in a tabular format, use a table.

Plain and simple.
