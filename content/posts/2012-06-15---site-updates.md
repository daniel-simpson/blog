So anyone who has actually been paying attention may notice a few updates to the site.  This is very much a work in progress, but I'm getting there... slowly.

What I've done...

* Added a [travel section](http://brendanmckenzie.com/travel/2012/east-africa) where I can outline trips I have and will take
* Made it so I can [flag on a map](http://brendanmckenzie.com/travel) all the places I have been to and where I want to go
* Added the ability to comment on blog posts
* Made it so trips and parts of trips can be linked to blog posts
* Made the whole blog section mobile friendly

What I'm still working on...

* Making the travel section mobile friendly
* Sorting out something with my portfolio, I really want to make it something special, what it'll be I have no idea, but keep an eye on it!
* Find a way to nicely attach media (photos, videos and what not) to blog posts (and subsequently trips)
* I'll probably keep tweaking the look of the site a bit, but that's something I'll probably never stop doing.
* Make my "about" page a bit more special
* Start translating the pages into Polish

Anyway... enjoy the site and feel free to give me some feedback!
