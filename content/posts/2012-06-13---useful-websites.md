In building this website there have been a couple of websites that have been quite useful.

Here are a few of them..

* <http://subtlepatterns.com/> great for subtle backgrounds
* <http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/> good for icons to use on maps. I haven't actually made use of this yet, but plan to for my travel section
* <http://webcreme.com/> good for inspiration
* <http://buero-buero.org/> I just thought this was cool, initially I thought of going down a path like this, but decided to opt for the more conservative look.  I may do something a little more fancy for my portfolio section
* <http://ideaexhibit.com/> I really liked the idea of this one as well
* <http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/> I use markdown (and subsequently this library) for authoring content
* <http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/> I use this for making source code in my blog posts prettier
